[![Made for Home Assistant](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20for-Home%20Assistant-41BDF5?style=for-the-badge&logo=home-assistant&logoColor=white)](https://www.home-assistant.io)

Control a variable speed drive (such as the iSAVER+ 1100) using an ESP32 and ESPHome, fully integrated with Home Assistant. This setup lets you read actual RPM, set speed, and control power via Modbus over RS485.


### ⚠️ Disclaimer

This configuration has only been tested on the following device:

🔗 [InverSilence iSAVER+ 1100 – Folkpool](https://www.folkpool.se/produkter/pool/cirkulationssystemet/frekvensstyrningar-och-tillbehor/inversilence-1-fas-varvtalsstyrning-power-1100.html)

I take **no responsibility** for how this setup might impact your device. Use it at your own risk. Your specific model **may not be compatible**, and incorrect usage might damage your equipment.

If you do manage to get it working with a different variable speed drive, I’d love to hear about it — your feedback could help others in the community!

## 📡 ESPHome Configuration

Two YAML configurations are available in [`esphome/`](esphome/):

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`pool-pump-wifi.yaml`](esphome/pool-pump-wifi.yaml) | Standard ESP32 with WiFi |
| [`pool-pump-thread.yaml`](esphome/pool-pump-thread.yaml) | ESP32-C6 with OpenThread (Matter) |

To use it:

1. Replace credentials in your `secrets.yaml`
2. Flash your ESP32
3. Add the device to Home Assistant
4. Optionally adjust the Modbus logic to fit your specific drive

## 💡 Dashboard Preview

Here’s what the finished control panel looks like in Home Assistant:

![Dashboard Preview](images/pump.png)

## 🏡 Home Assistant Integration

You can use the exposed `number`, `sensor`, `switch`, and `button` entities directly in dashboards or automations.

### Lovelace Files

Lovelace files are in [`examples/lovelace/`](examples/lovelace/)

## 🧪 Bonus: Temporary Max Speed Script

To enable the “Max RPM for 2h!” button, create this in your `scripts.yaml` or load it from [`examples/scripts/`](examples/scripts/):

```yaml
alias: Pump Max Then Restore
mode: single
sequence:
  - variables:
      previous: "{{ states('number.pump_rpm_regulator_pool_pump_rpm') | int }}"
  - service: number.set_value
    target:
      entity_id: number.pump_rpm_regulator_pool_pump_rpm
    data:
      value: 2900
  - delay: "02:00:00"
  - service: number.set_value
    target:
      entity_id: number.pump_rpm_regulator_pool_pump_rpm
    data:
      value: "{{ previous }}"
```

## 🔌 Wiring Diagram (ASCII)

### ⚠️ Important Wiring Note

> The RE and DE pins on the RS485 module **must be tied together** and connected to a single GPIO.  
> This ensures proper half-duplex direction control for Modbus communication.

**WiFi variant (ESP32Dev):** TX=GPIO17, RX=GPIO16, RE/DE=GPIO5  
**Thread variant (ESP32-C6):** TX=GPIO18, RX=GPIO19, RE/DE=GPIO21

```

## 🧠 How It Works

This ESPHome config sends and receives Modbus messages over UART using a custom lambda. It sets the desired RPM via a Modbus write and reads the current RPM in a loop.

A GPIO pin is used to toggle the RS485 write-enable line before/after communication to avoid collisions.


## 💧 Smarter Pool Pump Scheduling

GoNow when you have variable speed pump you might want to save energy *and* keep things quiet? We've put together a simple example that helps you figure out a daily schedule based on your pool size and pump settings.

Check it out here:  
👉 [docs/example_schedule.md](docs/example_schedule.md)

It shows:
- How to calculate how much water your pump needs to move
- What different RPMs mean for flow and power use
- A sample schedule that keeps things clean without wasting energy

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Wrong or missing RPM readings

If you can send commands to the pump but RPM readings are incorrect or absent, enable `DEBUG` logging in ESPHome and check the serial output.

Add or update the `logger` block in your YAML to set the log level:

```yaml
logger:
  level: DEBUG
```

Then flash the device and open the ESPHome log viewer — either via the ESPHome dashboard ("Logs" button) or with:

```bash
esphome logs pool-pump-wifi.yaml
```

The config emits two diagnostic log lines per poll cycle:

- **`Bytes available after TX`** — if this is non-zero, your RS485 module is echoing transmitted bytes back on RX (common when RE/DE direction control is missing or wired incorrectly).
- **`Response (N bytes avail): XX XX XX XX XX XX XX`** — the full raw 7-byte response frame in hex. Share this if your RPM values look wrong — your drive may use a different byte offset than the iSAVER+ 1100 this was built for.

See [issue #6](https://github.com/htilly/ha-esp32-variable-speed-drive-esphome/issues/6) for a real-world example with a different iSAVER model.
